This version of the PlaceMark application is developed using the Svelte framework.

It is an application that will allow users to store points of interest(POI) to them.

The user is able to enter the POI name, description, select a category it belongs to and provide it's latitude and longitude.
A map is provided which has markers on all the users Placemarks that it has created. The markers can be filtered by category.

The user is then able to log visits to that POI and what activity they took part in. This visit log page also provides a summary of the activities as well as graphs them.
A trend of the weather at the POI is also provided to allow the user to see what recent conditions have been. They also have the ability to upload an image of that POI as well as delete it.
